Packages for Octave Online Server
=================================

## Methodology

There are 70+ packages on Octave Forge and many others hosted elsewhere.

In order to determine the relative popularity of packages, the page [Individual Package Releases](https://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20Forge%20Packages/Individual%20Package%20Releases/) is referenced.  The following methodology is used to determine packages to add or remove:

1. Add packages that have at least 40 downloads/week.
2. Keep packages that have less than 40 but at least 10 downloads/week.
3. Drop packages that have less than 10 downloads/week.

In addition, no packages whose primary purpose is interacting with hardware devices, since Octave Online Server does not support hardware devices.
